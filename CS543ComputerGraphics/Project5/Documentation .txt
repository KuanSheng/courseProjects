How to operate on my project:
In windows system, double click the GLSLExperiment.sln to start the project. Then press F5 to run the project. 
The program behave as follows.

User hits: 

Key 'O': Display original picture (usain_bolt.bmp)
Key 'L': Display picture with Luminance effect (gray scale)
Key 'N': Display image negative
Key 'D': Display image with edge detection effect
Key 'E': Display image with embossing effect
Key 'T': Display image with Toon rendering
Key 'W': Display image with Twirl Transformation
Key 'P': Display image with Ripple Transformation
Key 'S': Display image with Spherical Transformation

All the functions are implemented.

Implementation analyze:
In this project, we realize these very simple image processing technique by utilizing the fragment shader in OpenGL.

The original picture comes from the starter file, and is a 512*512 bmp picture. Use a opensource library bitmap (.bmp) 
image file loader called libbnoread.[case 0]

The Luminance effect is realized by change all 3 RGB value to a luminance value to show a gray scale picture.[case 1]

The nagative effect is simply change R,G,B to 1-R, 1-G, 1-B.[case 2]

The Edge effect is realized by using the sobel filter to extract the edge information. In this project, we set 
the threshold T to be 0.5 to show a obvious effect.[case 3]

The embossing is realized by first replace color by luminance, then Highlight images differently depending on 
edge angles. it combined the Luminance effect and edge effect.[case 4]

The Toon shader effect is based on the sobel filter and set the color large than threshold to be black and then 
quantize the rest. The threshold here is also 0.5;[case 5]

The Twirl, Ripple, and Spherical Transformation is realized by methods presented in ppt.[case 6, case 7, case 8]
